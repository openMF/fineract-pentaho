## Build & Use For Linux Users

This project is currently only tested against the very latest and greatest
bleeding edge Fineract `develop` branch on Linux Ubuntu 20.04LTS. Building and using it against
other versions may be possible, but is not tested or documented here.

1. Download and compile

```bash
    git clone https://github.com/openMF/fineract-pentaho.git
    cd fineract-pentaho && ./mvnw -Dmaven.test.skip=true clean package && cd ..
```
2. Export the Location of Pentaho Reports (prpt files) in a variable required by the Plugin

```bash
    export FINERACT_PENTAHO_REPORTS_PATH="$PWD/fineract-pentaho/pentahoReports/"
```    

3. Execute Apache Fineract with the location of the Mifos Pentaho Plugin library for Apache Fineract

```bash
java -Dloader.path=$MIFOS_PENTAHO_PLUGIN_HOME/libs/ -jar $APACHE_FINERACT_HOME/fineract-provider.jar
```

4. Test the Pentaho Reports Execution using the following curl example or through the Mifos Web App in the Reports Menu

```bash
    curl --location --request GET 'https://localhost:8443/fineract-provider/api/v1/runreports/Expected%20Payments%20By%20Date%20-%20Formatted?tenantIdentifier=default&locale=en&dateFormat=dd%20MMMM%20yyyy&R_startDate=01%20January%202022&R_endDate=02%20January%202023&R_officeId=1&output-type=PDF&R_loanOfficerId=-1' \
--header 'Fineract-Platform-TenantId: default' \
--header 'Authorization: Basic bWlmb3M6cGFzc3dvcmQ='
```

5. The output must be a PDF with the Expected Payment By Date Formated information in it (maybe it could have blank or zeroes if it is a fresh Fineract Setup)

The API call (above) should not fail if you follow the steps as shown, and all conditions met for the version of Apache Fineract

If the API call (above) [fails with](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FINERACT-1173) 
_`"There is no ReportingProcessService registered in the ReportingProcessServiceProvider for this report type: Pentaho"`_, 
then this Fineract Pentaho Plugin has not been correctly registered & loaded by Apache Fineract.

Please note that the library will work using the latest Apache Fineract development branch (14th February 2024), also make sure you got installed the type fonts required by the reports. This Pentaho plugin will work only on Tomcat 10+. 

See also [`PentahoReportsTest`](src/test/java/org/mifos/fineract/pentaho/PentahoReportsTest.java) and the [`test`](test) script.


## License

This code used to be part of the Mifos codebase before it became Apache Fineract.
During that move, the Pentaho related code had to be removed, because Pentaho's license
prevents code using it from being part of an Apache Software Foundation hosted project.

The correct technical solution to resolve such conundrums is to use a plugin architecture - which is what this is.

Note that the code and report templates in this git repo itself are
[licensed to you under the Mozilla Public License 2.0 (MPL)](https://github.com/openMF/fineract-pentaho/blob/develop/LICENSE).
This is a separate question than the license that Pentaho itself (i.e. the JAR/s of Pentaho) are made available under.
